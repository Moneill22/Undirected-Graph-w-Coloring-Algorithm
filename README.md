# Undirected-Graph-w-Coloring-Algorithm

This project creates an undirected, unweighted graph object which can be used to represent adjacent states on a map or fish in a fish tank that may or may not be compatible and thus must be sorted accordingly. This project contains an algorithm to determine the minimum number of unique colors required to color these graph objects.
